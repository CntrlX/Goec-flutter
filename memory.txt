MEMORY FILE - GOEC FLUTTER PROJECT

PRIME DIRECTIVE: Fix Flutter build errors 

PREVIOUS ISSUES: ✅ ALL FIXED
1. ✅ Core library desugaring for flutter_local_notifications
   - Added isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true to compileOptions
   - Added dependencies block with coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4")

2. ✅ R8/ProGuard rules missing for Razorpay dependency
   - Created proguard-rules.pro file with Razorpay-specific keep rules
   - Added -keep class com.razorpay.** { *; } to prevent R8 removal
   - Added -dontwarn proguard.annotation.** and -keep class proguard.annotation.** { *; }
   - Updated release buildType in build.gradle.kts with isMinifyEnabled = true
   - Added proguardFiles configuration to apply the rules

3. ✅ Type casting error with CarouselController
   - Fixed carousel controller type mismatch in homepage_controller.dart
   - Changed Rx<CarouselController> to Rx<carousel.CarouselSliderController>
   - Updated map_screen.dart and map_functions.dart type casting to match CarouselSliderController
   - Changed animateTo to animateToPage to match carousel_slider 5.x API

4. ✅ Google Maps API key missing from AndroidManifest.xml
   - Added Google Maps API key meta-data element to AndroidManifest.xml
   - Fixed crash: "API key not found" error

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Flutter project located in: goec_flutter/
- Android config: goec_flutter/android/app/build.gradle.kts
- ProGuard rules: goec_flutter/android/app/proguard-rules.pro
- AndroidManifest: goec_flutter/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- Uses Kotlin DSL for Gradle configuration
- Current Java compatibility: VERSION_11
- Carousel slider version: 5.0.0

SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
1. Core library desugaring enables Java 8+ APIs on older Android versions
2. ProGuard rules prevent R8 from removing Razorpay classes during release build optimization
3. Carousel controller type alignment with carousel_slider 5.x API
4. Google Maps API key properly configured for Android native integration
