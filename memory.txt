MEMORY FILE - GOEC FLUTTER PROJECT

PRIME DIRECTIVE: Fix Flutter build errors 

PREVIOUS ISSUE: ✅ FIXED - Core library desugaring for flutter_local_notifications
- ✅ Added isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true to compileOptions
- ✅ Added dependencies block with coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4")

CURRENT ISSUE: ✅ FIXED - R8/ProGuard rules missing for Razorpay dependency

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
- ✅ Created proguard-rules.pro file with Razorpay-specific keep rules
- ✅ Added -keep class com.razorpay.** { *; } to prevent R8 removal
- ✅ Added -dontwarn proguard.annotation.** and -keep class proguard.annotation.** { *; }
- ✅ Updated release buildType in build.gradle.kts with isMinifyEnabled = true
- ✅ Added proguardFiles configuration to apply the rules

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Flutter project located in: goec_flutter/

- ProGuard rules: goec_flutter/android/app/proguard-rules.pro
- Uses Kotlin DSL for Gradle configuration
- Current Java compatibility: VERSION_11

SOLUTION APPLIED:
ProGuard rules prevent R8 from removing Razorpay classes and ProGuard annotations during release build optimization
